# GoogleWebsite

The website functions like a Google Search Website, the user put the keyword into a box and then moves them to a different website with all the sites that match the keyword

# Technology

- A web crawler built by me to put over 10000 pages into a MySql database in PHP
- The database then use Elasticseacrch, a tool to help speed up search time to under 3 seconds
- The website is then connected to the database through a JSON file, and use for searching purposes
