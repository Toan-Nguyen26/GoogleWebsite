# Java-Web-App

The Java web app was built for Android phones. It functions like a normal Google Search App only with basic functionality like searching and refreshing, once the user search for a keyword it will send the user to another page to show the result.

# Technology

- This app uses the same MySql database that was created and used in my [Google Search Website](https://github.com/Toan-Nguyen26/GoogleWebsite) using PHP
- The app UI was in Java for more flexibility for different phone

# Note

The app was canceled and stopped working due to VM on Google Cloud expired on October, 2021.
